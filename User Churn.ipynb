    "# Predicting User Churn Using Machine-Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "##### User churn is a leading problem for our clients, with it being 5-25 times more costly to acquire a customer compared to retaining an existing customer. The following exercise  produces a model that predicts whether a user is going to churn based on their streaming and misc. data over a 3 month period.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Data comes from a dataset of plays and views of approximatly 3000 users between 17th June and 17th September, with top-level data cleansing performed within SQL (such as allocation of plays to each rail and inclusion of metadata). All other data cleansing is performed below. The data is aggregated into month sections. A description of the data available can be found below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- user_primaryid - this is a unique identifier given to each user\n",
    "- action_time_frame - the time frame in question - given as days away from the end of the period\n",
    "- ActionandAdventure - the total plays going to Action content\n",

    "1. EDA - investigate metadata and beacons dataset to understand what features are possible.\n",
    "2. Implement features (see 'Features Desired')\n",
    "3. Reshaping - Reshape the dataset so its more suitable for machine learning - the idea is to compress the data into columns e.g. plays within x days, views within x days to make later machine learning more easy\n",
    "4. Date Cleansing - perform data cleansing techniques learnt during the course on the raw data\n",
